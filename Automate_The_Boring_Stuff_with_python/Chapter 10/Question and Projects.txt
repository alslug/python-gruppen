Practice Projects
For practice, write a program that does the following.

Debuggin Coin Toss
The following program is meant to be a simple coin toss guessing game. The player
gets two guesses (itâ€™s an easy game). However, the program has several bugs in it.
Run through the program a few times to find the bugs that keep the program from
working correctly.

import random
guess = ''
while guess not in ('heads', 'tails'):
	print('Guess the coin toss! Enter heads or tails:')
	guess = input()
toss = random.randint(0, 1) # 0 is tails, 1 is heads
if toss == guess:
	print('You got it!')
else:
	print('Nope! Guess again!')
	guesss = input()
	if toss == guess:
		print('You got it!')
	else:
		print('Nope. You are really bad at this game.')
